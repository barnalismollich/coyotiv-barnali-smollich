# **Family Diary**

In the main branch in Github of barnalismollich/coyotiv-barnali-smollich you can find my project work I did during the software engineering training at Coyotiv UG in March - June 2022.

# **Project idea**

My project called "Family Diary" has the intention to be a website which should function as aÂ  storage of our most important documents. Only family members (husband, all children and me) should have access to this page. Starting point should be a login page as the contents is sensitive. The main page is a list of our most important documents (testament, living will, power of attorney, passport number, vaccination certicate and so on) which in case of emergency can be accessed fast and easily.

# **Goal**

Store the most important documents in the application i.e. upload and download of documents are possible (although usability has to be improved).

# **Non-Goals**

1. Information only for family and not for the public (thus login and logout functions are mandatory).
2. No todo or shopping list.
3. Form follows function, i.e. the website contains mandatory stuff (Privacy Policy, Terms of use) but is not a fancy website.
4. Only storage of documents. No storage of photos, videos and audios in the first version.
5. Chat tool is integrated but more to show that I have worked with socket.io and not because it is a mandatory feature.
6. Deletion of documents and version control are not possible until now.

# **References and Sources**

Evernote, Penzu, Jimdo and Wix templates, tutorials at Coyotiv UG e.g. balsamiq, Google drive, Amazon drive

# **Technologies**

Frontend: Vue.js, Vuex, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, balsamiq

Backend: MongoDB Atlas, Docker, Google Cloud Run, socket.io, node

In Google Cloud Run one was able to see the application in the productive environment during the course. As it was a showcase project and not to be used in real life, it is inactive now. Here are some screenshots from the frontend and backend.
