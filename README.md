# coyotiv-barnali-smollich

Hello!! This is my folder for my project I did during the training at Coyotiv UG.

Project idea
My project idea is called: Family diary and documents

Rough idea

I want to build a website which will function as a storage of our most important documents. Only family members (husband, 4 daughters and me) have access to this page. Starting point is a login page as the contents is sensitive. The main page is then a list of our most important documents (Testament, Patientenverf√ºgung, Betreuungsvollmacht, passport copies, Impfpass etc.) which in case of emergency can be accessed easily.

Goals

Store the most important documents centrally (upload, download, delete, version control?)

Non-Goals

Information/ diary only for family not for the public so shall not be found in search engines
No chat tool. No todo / shopping list.
Form follows function, i.e. it can just be a plain white website with a header and "Impressum" and other mandatory stuff (Privacy, Policy) and not a fancy website.
Only storage of documents. No storage of photos, videos in the first version.
I would like to write / tape diary regularly in order not to forget the happy and unhappy moments in our family life but audios will not be done in first version.
